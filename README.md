# Alzheimer's Disease Classification Using LSTM Recurrent Neural Network

This repository is based on the research from the article **"EEG-Based Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Recognition Using Robust-PCA and LSTM Recurrent Neural Network"** by Alessandrini et al., published in Sensors (2022). The study proposes a method for classifying Alzheimer's disease patients using EEG data, combining Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks.

## Overview

This repository focuses on applying **LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** for the classification of EEG data to distinguish Alzheimer's disease patients from healthy individuals. The method leverages **Robust-PCA** to preprocess the EEG data before feeding it into the LSTM model for time-series classification.

### Dataset
The EEG dataset used in this project contains three classes: **AD** (Alzheimer's Disease), **N** (Normal)
The data undergoes preprocessing to extract key features using Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and is then fed into the LSTM for classification.

## Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by the work presented by Alessandrini et al. in 2022.
